<h4 style="font-family: verdana">Watching Kdrama</h4>
<p style="font-family: verdana">
  As an easy pass time, i love watching Kdramas from online streaming platforms.
  It relaxes my mind and make me feel like I'm in the series itself experiencing
  the scenes from the series. Some of my favorites are Queen of Tears, Full
  house, Vincenzo and Decendants of the sun.

<h4 style="font-family: verdana">Aerial Fitness</h4>
<p style="font-family: verdana">
  I have started with pole fitness in 2012 and became a beginners' instructor
  after a few years. It was my stress reliever before giving birth to my first
  kid and going back to the province to take care of my small family. I love the
  thrill it gives me especially when I nail a hard trick.

<h4 style="font-family: verdana">Yoga</h4>
<p style="font-family: verdana">
  It has started during the height of pandemic, when we all got no where to go
  and nothing much to do. This kept me sane while being on lockdown. I have
  trained to be a teacher after a year and 2 and got my certification. I enjoy
  learning new things related to yoga that relates to my current life, kids and
  pregnancy. So, I have taken up some trainings as well for Kids and Pre/Post
  Natal yoga.

<h4 style="font-family: verdana">Anything Fitness</h4>
<p style="font-family: verdana">
  I guess I really enjoy working my body and discovering new things that it can
  do. So I also love the usual workout like lifting weights and it's of course
  more fun when doing it with friends.
